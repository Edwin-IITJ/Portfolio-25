      "fullDescription": "A conceptual VR experience centered on fruit learning, where users virtually interact with 3D fruit models, pluck them, inspect cross-sections, and gradually internalize identity cues. The project emphasizes gesture‑based interactions, minimal UI distractions, and an exploratory learning flow. The design went through multiple iterations, tested with a pilot group, and incorporated heuristic feedback to refine onboarding, error prevention, and interface consistency.",

Developed storyboards for each verse and filler, drawing from mehndi motifs and Rajasthani visual traditions to ground the style. Set up a dark-room lightbox studio and worked in rotating shifts to keep animation continuous. Prioritized 'quality over quantity' by trimming weaker shots and focusing on clear, expressive movements. Intercut sand animation with performance footage of Pappu Ram to retain authenticity while enhancing the emotional arc.",

The project strengthened the team’s understanding of hand-made, analogue animation and the value of patience in frame-by-frame work.
