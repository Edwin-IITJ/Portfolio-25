The project emphasizes gesture‑based interactions, minimal UI distractions, and an exploratory learning flow. The design went through multiple iterations, tested with a pilot group, and incorporated heuristic feedback to refine onboarding, error prevention, and interface consistency.",

      "fullDescription": "The series studies how morning sun carves alleys, grilles, and cobbles into graphic lines, using negative space and silhouettes to choreograph movement. Narrative frames—like a child pausing at a threshold, a tree rising from a demolition plot, and a carved sentinel watching the bazaar—anchor the geometry in lived emotion. Each image is composed for edge tension and leading lines, favoring available light, high contrast, and restrained tonality to keep attention on gesture and place.",
